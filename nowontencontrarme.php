        <p>DHCP gives you an IP.

            Rules of communication or how we behave = Network Protocols

            Sockets are IP addressess AND ports put together Nodes are each parts of what makes a network.
            Hosts/servers have the resources that the clients look for/consume while the routers and switches
            help forward that traffic between each other.

            Large networks are 3 layer, core (routers and switches moving everything to other networks) distribution (filters traffic and is usually the layer that connects with other networrks, connects core with access) and access (connects distribution with end points).

            The point of a network is to transmit data. In a fast, reliable and predictable way.
